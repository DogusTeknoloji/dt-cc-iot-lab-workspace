> ## [What is Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
>
> Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. [Arduino boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products) are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the [Arduino programming language](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) (based on [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/)), and the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), based on [Processing](https://processing.org/).
